# Interweave
A highly customizable discord to fabric chat service.
# Setup
Create a discord application <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">here</a>, create a bot and invite it to your server. Note down the channel ID and discord bot token for later.

Put the jar in your fabric mods folder and launch your server, first launch with this mod will close the server and create a file called InterweaveConfig.json on the same level as your server jar. Open this file and fill out your config, you can remove a line with a parameter containing "Format" to disable that message or use the variables %sender% and %message% to customize your messages (each line will have all of its variables that it can take when the file is created). Put your discord bot token and channel id from earlier in the matching fields and launch your server!
